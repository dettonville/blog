      <description>If one has worked long enough with ansible, you might have gotten to the same frustation I have had.
Ansible has many scopes to store a variable value allowing for its supreme flexibility for maintaining a hardware/virtual machine inventory.
For example, for a target host VM instance, one can set the variable state at the host level in the inventory.
Another possibility, is if the setting is not unique to the machine, and if there are a group of such machines (pet / cattle), then one can set the variable state at the respective group level.</description>
